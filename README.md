# Recognition of Degraded Pattern 
## Single vs Multilayer Perceptron 

Pattern is the alphabet from A to Z. 
The two networks are trained on the intact Pattern.
Then, they test to recognise the pattern which is progressively degraded. 

Graphic representation:
    - Intact Pattern
    - Degraded Pattern
    - Error for both neural networks during training (y axis = epochs)
    - Error for both neural networks during testing (y axis = noise or degradation)
